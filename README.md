bot and gender identification for @PANCLEF2019
Nowadays the presence of bots over Twitter has increased rapidly.
Even though Twitter has anti-spam policies, the bots can bypass them easily.
Bots are easy to implement by anyone who has basic knowledge on that domain.
Some bots react to a particular keyword which is more likely related to a trending topic.
Some  bots randomly tweet predefined statements or phrases. 
In some other cases, the bots are designed to highlight a popular entity like an anime character, historic icon, celebrity characters, etc.
Based on the popular phrases related to the fields. In addition to them, some bots are not fully automated (in other words we can say fake accounts).
Bots on social media create influence on the users for commercial, political or ideolog-ical purposes by posing as humans. For example, consider when we are shopping weusually check the rating of the product and the number of ratings, taking this as an ad-vantage the bots will rate the product and change the view of the product (positively ornegatively). The bots on social media can directly tilt the fate of politics which makesthem an even greater threat.
This influence made the German political parties reject the use of bots intheir election campaign. In other ways, bots are well known for spreading rumours orfake news. With these major threats, the identification of the bots on social media usingAuthor Profiling raised its importance from various domains like marketing, forensics,and security. The aim is to find whether the author is human or bot and if the author ishuman we have to further classify gender (male or female) based on the tweets given.
For pre-processing of text, we are using the NLTK library to create a TweetTokenizer,TreeBankTokenizer, etc to perform tokenization and some other procedure using regexand identified the emoticons and renamed them with negative and positive emojis togeneralize the emojis used.
